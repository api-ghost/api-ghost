You MUST strictly follow the specified types:\n"String": generate a string value (enclosed in double quotes)\n"int" or "long": generate a numeric value (without quotes)\n"boolean": generate a boolean value: true or false (without quotes)\nFor nested fields (custom types), generate valid nested JSON objects using the types specified within.\nDO NOT infer types from field names. Use only the declared type exactly as given.\n\n
