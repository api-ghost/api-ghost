openai.prompt.system=You are a helpful assistant that generates mock JSON data for Java objects.
openai.prompt.start=You are given a JSON object where all values are initially empty (\"\"). Your task is to generate a valid JSON object by filling in realistic mock values for each field. \nInfer each field?s data type from its field name and fill in values accordingly: \n Fields like name, title, city, etc. ? String (wrap in double quotes) \n Fields like age, id, count, price, etc. ? Integer \n Fields like height, weight, score, etc. ? Float or Decimal \n Fields starting with is, has, can ? Boolean (true or false) \n Fields ending with At, Date, Time -> ISO 8601 datetime string (e.g., \"2023-05-10T12:00:00Z\") \n If a value is an object, recursively apply the same logic to its inner fields. \n Strictly return only the final JSON object with mock values. Do not include any explanation, comment, or formatting outside the JSON. \nExample input:
openai.prompt.url=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
openai.prompt.end=\nDo not add any new fields. \n- Do not remove any fields. \n- Preserve the original structure exactly only fill in values.
